Foremast-Template-Examples
===========================

This is the repository is used for providing example Foremast templates.

Foremast comes bundled with default templates but they can all be overridden with external templates. This repository acts as examples for how the external templates can be structured.

External Foremast Templates
---------------------------

In your `foremast.cfg` add a `templates_path` key. This can be an absolute value or a path relative to where you are running Foremast. The value of this config key should be the path to the directory which holds the external Foremast templates

The structure of your templates directory should match the defaults provided with Foremast. The names of the files also need to be the same with the exception of pipeline stages.
